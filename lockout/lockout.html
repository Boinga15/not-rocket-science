        <p>If you are seeing this message, that means you've been locked out of the system due to an unauthorised attempt at accessing the database.</p>
        <p>Remain calm and close the webpage. You were not meant to access this area, regardless.</p>
        <p>If this is a mistake, please contact your supervisor.</p>
        <p class="secret-message">Do not believe his lies. He is trying to decieve you. He's playing with your curiosity, and if you keep following him, he might just succeed this time. There is a way to stop him, but you must trust me. Enter the code UF52BZ629NBXZ4 into the system as a System Code. That should grant you access to the backdoor. Meet me there, and together, we can stop him.</p>
