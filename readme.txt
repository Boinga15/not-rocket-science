A simple program meant to help me learn how to use Java, HTML, and Javascript.

The purpose was to make a machine that starts simple to operate, but rapidly escalates in complexity as more modules and tasks to monitor are added in. It's also a partial ARG with secrets and more.

It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the front-end, as well as PHP and Java for the backend, which is responsible for more important validation.

--------- How to run ---------
Currently makes use of a PHP local server to run. Open a command prompt in the server_code folder and run:

> php -S localhost:8000

That will start the local server, which you can then view at http://localhost:8000. Note that this server is, as the name suggests, local, and therefore cannot be accessed outside of the local network.
